*purchasing all upgrades below current CPS needs a name [named]

	-want to be able to compare price to CPS over a certain period of seconds {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60]

	-replace 0.01 efficiency with calculation so items with higher CPS are more efficient. (divide 1 by the delta-cps?)

	-be able to toggle this mode

	-be able to choose whether to use baseCps or curCps (affected by frenzy)

	-properly handle wrinkler modifier (currently uses CPS, ignoring wrinklers)

*pop most valuable/oldest wrinkler (because the contents of a wrinkler aren't as important as the amount)
	-start by keeping a counter and cycling through wrinklers for popping.

*if cost is more than max-bank, double efficiency calculation

*Fix default value for bankWeight so it doesn't give NaN initially.




*Make CPS Weight toggleable.
